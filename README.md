Predicting Student Marks Based on Study Hours | Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict students’ exam marks based on the number of hours they study. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation, using a simple and interpretable supervised learning algorithm.

Objective

To analyze the relationship between study hours and academic performance and accurately predict student marks.

Project Workflow

* Data loading and inspection
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
* Data preprocessing and train–test split
* Model training using Linear Regression
* Prediction of marks for new study hour inputs
* Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score

Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

Key Insights

* A strong positive linear relationship exists between study hours and marks
* The model provides reliable predictions for unseen data
* Linear Regression is effective for simple, real-world prediction problems

Outcome

The trained model successfully predicts student marks based on study hours, making this project a strong foundation for understanding supervised machine learning and regression analysis.
